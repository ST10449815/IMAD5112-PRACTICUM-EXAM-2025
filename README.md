  Purpose of the application: 

The purpose of the application is to store song details and allow users to create and manage playlists. The user should be able to rate songs, add comments, and enter information about the artist. 

 

Main Screen:

This is the main screen of the application. This is where the user will be able to enter the details of the song such as song name, artist name, ratings from 1 to 5 and add comments. For the user to enter the details about the song, I used plain text and for the title of the app. I had used a text view. When they have entered the information, they will click on the add to playlist button and it will add the song details to the playlist. There is also a screen two button for the user to navigate to screen two and an exit app button which the user can use to exit the app.

I had used arrays in the above screen due to there being a list of items.

This screen shows error handling and how I handled the errors. It shows what would happen if the data was entered incorrectly and if no data was entered at all. 

This screen also shows that the user would be able to enter the song title, artist name, ratings and comments, and store the information.

This screen shows the buttons that I implemented. The add button which allows the user to add the song details to the playlist. The next screen button navigates the user to the second screen. The exit button exits the app when clicked.

This is the detailed view screen (second screen) of the app. I implemented three buttons on this screen. The display list of songs button displays the songs and the details about the song that the user entered when clicked. 

The main screen button navigates the user to the main screen (first screen) when clicked. 

The average rating of songs button calculates and displays the average rating of songs in the playlist.

In this screen, I implemented what would happen when each button is clicked. I had also ensured that the song details entered would be displayed on the screen.
